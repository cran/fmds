\description{
\code{fastpolynomialmds} performs monotone polynomial multidimensional scaling.
The function follows algorithms given by de Leeuw and Heiser (1980).
The data, dissimilarities and weights, are either symmetric or asymmetric.
The dissimilarities are may contain negative values, the weights may not.
The configuration is either unrestricted, (partly) fixed, or a linear combination of independent variables.
The dissimilarities are optimally monotone transformed following a polynomial function.
