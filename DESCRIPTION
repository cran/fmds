Description: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) functions for various tasks that are beyond the beta stage and way past the alpha stage.
             Currently, options are available for weights, restrictions, classical scaling or principal coordinate analysis, transformations (linear, power, Box-Cox, spline, ordinal), outlier mitigation (rdop), out-of-sample estimation (predict), negative dissimilarities, fast and faster executions with low memory footprints, penalized restrictions, cross-validation-based penalty selection, supplementary variable estimation (explain), additive constant estimation, mixed measurement level distance calculation, restricted classical scaling, etc. More will come in the future.
